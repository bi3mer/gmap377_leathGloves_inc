Bolts & Warping Guide
----------------------

1. The number of bolts needed to activate the warp is a public var on the ScoreManager. Set this to the desired number.
2. The destination of the warp needs to be set. If not set, the game will crash when you attempt to warp. 
3. This is just a quick version for friday's build. Purpose is to warp from planet 1 to planet 2. Do not mistake this for a final
implementation.
