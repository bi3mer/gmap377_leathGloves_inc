###Development Notes:

Each of you have been given a folder:
```
/assets/Scenes/colanScene.unity
```

This scene is for use, and only your use. If you use someone else file you potentitally screw this up for
everyone else. Make sure to only use your scene when developing. The point of these scenes is to develop
prefabs which can be transferred over to:

```
/assets/Scens/mainEnvironment.unity
```

In the main environment we will use the collection of prefabs to create the end game scene. If you want to 
add to the main environment scene only do so after you've finished your prefabs and have verified that no
one else is editing it already. Generally it'll be best to do during our weekly meetings whene everyone can
verify they aren't editing the scene.

If two people do edit the scene at the same time, than the person to first commit will be given priority when
I fix the repo. The second persons commit will be reverted, so we have a clean build. Note when, this issue comes
up contact me so I can fix it. If you feel up to the task feel free to fix it yourself.

For writing scripts, we will be using comments for every function. When done writing the funciton go the top of it
and type 
```
///
```
this will generate comments for you like:
```
///<Summary>
///...summary
///</Summary>
```
On top of that, complicated functions will require comments for the more difficult parts to understand. Use common 
sense, I believe in you guys.

change.log is where you can log added details of what was done for the day.

As I think of more, this file will be updated to include new guidelines.
